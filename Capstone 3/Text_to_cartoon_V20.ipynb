    "1) Collect and preprocess data: Gather a dataset of cartoons and their corresponding descriptions or captions. I have scraped online to gather a vast amount of cartoons. Image downloader youtube plugin was used to collect the data. The cartoons collected as such had their file name as the key and hence not much cleaning was necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Train an NLP model: There are multiple ways to deal with the text recognition. for example, we can take advantage of a pre-trained language model or train our own using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. In this project we will be first try a pre-attention simple NLP model. Next we'll be using pre-trained models such as GPT or BARD using their API. \n",

    "3) Train a computer vision model: Again multiple ways to do it such as using a pre-trained image recognition model like VGG or Inception, or train our own model if we have a large labeled dataset. For this project we'll try a pre-trained model from Huggingface.\n",
